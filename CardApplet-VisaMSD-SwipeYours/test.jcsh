#  Reset the card (same as /atr) and then selects default card manager:
/card

# Open a secure channel to card manager
auth

#  install -i <instance-AID> C9#([install-params]) <package-AID> <applet-AID>
#
#  Install the PPSE (Proximity Payment Secure Environment) and the specified
#  card applet to the simulator.
#
#  We allow use of a pipe symbol in these commands which converts ascii
#  symbols into hex.  For example:
#
#      |com.st      is shorthand for:  636f6d2e7374
#      |Ppse2Pay    is shorthand for:  5070736532506179
#      |CardApplet  is shorthand for:  436172644170706c6574
#
#  Our JavaCard implementation does not have a 16 character AID size limit that
#  standard JavaCard implementations have.
#
#  The first command installs the PPSE applet using its standard name
#  in widespread use on payment terminals: "2PAY.SYS.DDF01"
#  (325041592e5359532e4444463031). The C9# pararmeter personalizes the default
#  card applet ID of the point of sale applet. A0000000031010 is the
#  registered VISA AID.
install -i |2PAY.SYS.DDF01 -q C9#(A0000000031010) |com.st |Ppse2Pay

#
#  The second command installs our test applet as VISA's AID (A0000000031010).
#  This is just a stub applet that doesn't respond to any instructions.
#
install -i A0000000031010 -q C9#() |com.st |CardApplet

#  Example commands to select individual applets for testing:
/select |2PAY.SYS.DDF01
/select A0000000031010
/atr
